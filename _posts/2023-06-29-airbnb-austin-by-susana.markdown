## Review

Overall my first impression of the place was that of a rather run down College Dorm.  The parking was under the apartments and it looked like quite a few of the apartments were not draining the HVAC properly.  Much of the roof of the parking (under the apartments) was wet and moldy.  Usually AC units will pump the excess water to a drain, but some of these units seemed to be just dripping it through to the parking garage.  Really bad to route all your moisture to a dark shady portion where it will not quickly evaporate.

When we arrived at the actual unit, there was nothing that immediately jumped out, though the air did smell dusty / musty.  But as soon as we started using the living space all sorts of problems became readily apparent.  And I'm not the first to make these observations.  On May of 2023, user Adam had a similar review to mine, but I decided to take some pictures as well.  I was willing to just go along with things until the list of problems began to mount.

Our first problem was with the toilet.  It had no lid, just the seat, then the flushing handle fell off. I don't know about you, but I generally put the lid down before I flush because... well I know what aerates when a toilet is flushed.  I mean honestly it's a $20 seat at home depot, the fact that it was left unfixed is rather disgusting.  So then I began to look around and this didn't make me feel any better.  I immediately noticed the AC vents were CAKED with dust.  It was soo bad that the ceiling near the vents were stained from either dust or mold coming from the AC vent.

Next was the kitchen.  The property is listed as including a toaster, but there isn't one.  Nor are there any bowls to eat out of.  Just some plates and cups.  The utensils were kept in an absolutely disgusting rusty utensil holder, and the knives in the knife block were dirty with food, grease and rust on them.  The cupboard was grimy and without any shelf-paper or anything keeping the glass rims clean.  The cabinetry wasn't even enclosed but rather open to the crawl spaces between the walls and under the appliances.  Great breading ground for roaches.  Yes, we'll get to them later.  So, what DID the kitchen have?  Well it had a microwave caked in with rust, a stovetop that couldn't hold a pan (wrong spacers) and no pans to cook in, only pots.  Yes, there is a difference between pots and pans.

Now for the art and knickknacks.   Well I guess the last guest stole them, because most every wall was bare.  Not that I'm really care about artwork, but why even put them in the pictures of the place if your just going to take them down and move them to another rental.  I guess that is where the toaster and bowls are as well.  The only thing on the wall I found was a grate from the freezer and a clock without batteries.  Not even the fire extinguishers were on the wall.  They were in a drawer waiting for batteries.

This is the point where I picked up the camera and started clicking.  With the amount of dust and mold, I doubt there was a fire risk in site, but there are rules on AirBnB about renting property without fire extinguishers.  I don't know why this property hasn't been delisted yet.  So... now I take a critical eye to things and my impressions go from bad to worse.  There is soo much dust in the air, that the floorboards are caked with the stuff, as well as the door jams.  I mean, with a $40 cleaning fee, what is actually cleaned here.  In Austin, $40 covers a few hours at minimum wage.  I can't imagine anyone spent more than 10 minutes cleaning this place.

So last day there, early morning checkout and my daughter starts making a fuss in the bathroom.  She grabs her phone and said she was trying to get a picture of a roach she found in the shower.  She could never catch up to it, but we did find it, or it's cousin, in the bedroom about a half hour later.  So now I'm ready to go, and per the hosts instructions I do as asked and take all the linen off of the pillows and mattresses.  This is where I just about retch in disgust.  The mattress is covered in urine and blood stains, and the pillows are nasty as well.  I figured this couldn't get any worse till I saw the "white crusty" stains on the headboard and couch.

I mean, look, I'm a pretty hardy fellow, but the thought of my wife and daughter sleeping on that filth is more than most any man can handle.  This place ***REALLY*** needs to be delisted.  The absolute lack of care that the host shows for the property is unimaginable.  Most all of this could be disguised in short order.  But no one, I mean ***NO ONE*** has any business renting property with matrices that look like that.  I'm not trying to tell her how to run her business, but if you have THAT much of a problem with guests urinating on beds put a plastic liner on them.

All told, this all could have escaped my detection if the host had done the following:

1. $20 toilet seat at Lowes
2. $20 toaster at Lowes
3. $20 for batteries at Lowes
4. $40 bed liner at Walmart
5. $40 microwave at Walmart
6. $50 for pillows at Walmart
7. $50 for shelf paper at Walmart
7. 30 minutes with an upholstery cleaner and a black light
8. 30 minutes with a vacuum nozzle on the baseboards and vents

Not that superficial cleaning would really improve the discusting conditions of the matrices

The spacer for the stove-top is ill fitting and prevents the burner from freely resting in the cutout it is designed for.  Hard to cook on a tilted pan.

Bathroom sink closest to toilet has no fasteners on the fixtures.  They are just floating there.

You know, I don't usually ponder what the inside of a knife block looks like... until now.

### Bathtub

OK, so this likely needs to be refinished.  The curtains may have been replaced since Adam complained, but the tub is definitely nasty.

### Baseboards

I get it, most college kids aren't going to be cleaning the baseboards, but, again, it just goes to show that there really isn't any serious cleaning going on here. 
<p>
    <a href="/assets/img/grimy-baseboard-1.jpg">

Another set of grimy baseboards.  I mean it's not that hard to clean these.  Just point a vacuum nozzle at them.

### Lidless Toilet

If you zoom in on the picture, you can see the hinge for the toilet lid where it is missing.

### Stained Mattresses

Normally I don't check the mattresses where I stay, but the hostess was very clear that I must strip the bed before I leave.  I mean ***DEAR LORD*** that is disgusting.  ***HOW*** did she not see those stains after she changed the linen on the bed.  I just can't even imagine.  I mean, I could maybe hope that is wine, but honestly, I'm no longer optimistic.

### Pillows no better
 
OK, maybe they didn't see the mattress, but the pillows are the simplest thing in the world to replace.  These are WAY past due.
<p>

### Dead Batteries

This annoyance is both the simplest to replace, and arguably the most dangerous.  When we arrived at the property two of the smoke detectors were sitting in a drawer since they were presumably beeping.  Of course the third started beeping and we notified the host, and she simply said to take it off the wall and remove the battery.  Even the wall clock was out of batteries.  Of all the maintenance that could have been done on this property, this seems the simplest to me.  When I pack for a trip, I don't usually pack 9V batteries assuming the smoke detectors are all going to be dead.  Unfortunately, my schedule was too tight in town for me to volunteer to fix this for the next guest.

Where are the smoke detectors?!?!

### Missing Bowls

I know this is boardering on the trivial, if we aren't at that point already, but isn't this called "Air Bed and ***Breakfast***".  I mean honestly, how are you going to eat cereal in the morning with no bowls.  And yes, that is exactly when I realized it.  Not only did I have to eat my cereal out of a coffee cup, but I had to rewash the cup and spoon due to the disgusting condition of the cupboard and utensil rack.

### Pealing paint

The apartment desprately needs a paint job.  Not my capital complaint about this property, but it really makes it look like no effort was made to fix this place up at all.

### Just random stuff

The fact that even something as simple as a missing freezer rack was left sitting around makes me thing that the host never entered this property at all.

### Cockroach

Of course there were cockroaches.  Daughter found the first one, but the nasty bugger was too quick for us to get a good shot of him.  This one seemed a bit less camera shy.  I'll just go ahead and assume that it's been hanging out on the dishes in the cabinets.
